WARNING:
Every effort was made to ensure this application will operate with minimal risk to the user. However, 
changing the named admin password through an automated solution carries some risk. The application attempts 
to account for any possible failures present both the results of the attempt, and the password used in the
attempt, but if any unforseen disruption prevents the application from successfully recording and displaying 
the pasword used, then you may be left with no record of the admin password used. Admin account passwords 
can be reset with physical access to the system, during a reboot of hte appliance. However, the safest and
easiest recovery method is to ensure the firewall is manged by Sophos Central. This will allow you to reset
the admin password even if it is unknown.
